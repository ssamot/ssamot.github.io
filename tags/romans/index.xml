The middle Stoics, early Christians, the Epicureans (yes&amp;hellip;), the Manichaeans views on sex can be summed up as &amp;ldquo;better to be avoided, if not do sparingly&amp;rdquo;. In early Christianity, there is ample evidence in the mainstream gospels (e.g. check Matthew and the sermon on the mount), supporting text (e.g. the very weird opening story of the Shepherd of Hermas) and in the surrounding fan fiction (e.g. of the Acts of Thomas, the Acts of Thecla, both which are widely and vividly anti-sex); the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; mode of operation is either celibacy or monogamy with the aim of procreation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
