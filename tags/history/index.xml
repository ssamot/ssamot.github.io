It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Timeline of human evolution and cultural development&amp;rdquo;, as it&amp;rsquo;s author would describe it, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most useful resources on the topic I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this script here to extract the relevant tables into CSV format for future processing.

It&amp;rsquo;s also rather interesting that US dominance was so complete, that no other country managed to to maintain local variants. I also wonder how much of it was down to resources/economics or technical capacity. The soviets would have to overhaul their whole economic system if they were to introduce computers successfully.</description></item><item><title>The Romans</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/romans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 11:24:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/romans/</guid><description>Beyond the roads and the sanitation, the most enduring Roman legacy must be the concept of property over men, things and animals &amp;ndash; a definition of self based on what you own.</description></item></channel></rss>
