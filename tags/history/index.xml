There is a table in https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/593608.Isaac_Newton, a biography of Newton which I read almost 20 years ago, which summarises Neuton&amp;rsquo;s prophecies. They were apparently derived from a close reading of the Bible, and not by any form of revelation. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me how he came up with these dates, or if the table has any validity at all. Another set of dates is reported here: https://www.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the desert of the real</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/desert/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 14:01:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/desert/</guid><description>One of the most astonishing facts about new media is how much their content is dedicated on commenting other media. Commentary on games, commentary on people playings games, commentary on people watching people playing games etc. We kind of need a measure for this &amp;ndash; something like &amp;ldquo;depth of hyperreality&amp;rdquo;. A documentary is level 0 hyperreal, a movie about the actual event the documentary is depicting level 1, two dudes on twitter watching the documentary level 2 etc.</description></item><item><title>Dawn of time</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/timeline/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 16:23:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/timeline/</guid><description>I was searching for a timeline of world events, and I stumbled upon this: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~cpd/history.html. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;Timeline of human evolution and cultural development&amp;rdquo;, as it&amp;rsquo;s author would describe it, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most useful resources on the topic I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this script here to extract the relevant tables into CSV format for future processing.

It&amp;rsquo;s also rather interesting that US dominance was so complete, that no other country managed to to maintain local variants. I also wonder how much of it was down to resources/economics or technical capacity. The soviets would have to overhaul their whole economic system if they were to introduce computers successfully.</description></item><item><title>The Romans</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/romans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 11:24:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/romans/</guid><description>Beyond roads and sanitation, the most enduring Roman legacy must be the concept of property over men, things and animals &amp;ndash; a definition of self based on what you own.</description></item></channel></rss>
