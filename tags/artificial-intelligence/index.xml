A new book is being released on the topic of Logic: Mathematical Logic through Python. Proof assistants (the likes of Lean) are being continuously developed and becoming more and more mainstream by the hour. I am pretty sure developments in these fronts will revolutionise the teaching of mathematics, making them accessible to whole groups of hobbyists, the same way that autodiff revolutionised ML.</description></item><item><title>Neats vs scruffies vs money</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/neats/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 06:05:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/neats/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon &amp;ldquo;What is the well dressed educator wearing now?&amp;rdquo;, an AI education article written in 1982, through a twitter thread. The article can be summed up as a commentary on whether one should pursue theoretical methods vs a more experimental approach (i.e. neats vs scruffies) and has been done to death since the article was written, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much new to say. What astonished me is the actual focus on education.</description></item><item><title>Big data</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/bigdata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 09:31:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/bigdata/</guid><description>Most interesting problems I have encountered in my real-life expeditions involve small data. Big data seems to me like a problem devised by certain tech companies and picked up as a trend by people that don&amp;rsquo;t need it, forcing them to use tools of extreme complexity, and as a result delaying project deployment.</description></item><item><title>Automation keeps being predicted</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/autom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 06:42:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/autom/</guid><description>Automation fears in the 50s, found on twitter, see https://twitter.com/abenanav/status/1526854505136021505
McKinsey (the consultancy) has a job automation chart here, posted in 2016. There seems to be a lingering fear of automation, as this old New York Time article, amply named &amp;ldquo;Automation Puts Industry on Eve of Fantastic Robot Era; Its Effect on Workers Spurs Unions&amp;rsquo; Drive for Annual Wage&amp;rdquo; seems to imply. Notice how McKinsey speculates that managers are secure from automation, though I doubt this is for the right reasons.</description></item><item><title>Failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 14:14:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth&amp;rdquo; (John 17:17) Tesla (the car business) recently published a video of its AI day giving a tour de force of modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. From monte carlo tree search to simulation-based reasoning, Tesla is throwing every modern technique to the problem of self driving cars, coupled with possibly some of the best research scientists and engineers in the business. Yet, somehow, this is not enough; as another video mocking Tesla for its inability to produce a self-driving car points out, the promise of real-world AI delivering anything that would resemble its science fiction counterpart is astoundingly far.</description></item></channel></rss>
