Lyons&amp;rsquo; Reality Honks Back&lt;/a>. It discusses Canadian truckers and the divide between &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; workers (which make use of real-world tools tools) and &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; workers (which deal primarily in information). It contains a flawed effort to link the whole divide to Gnosticism &amp;ndash; it astonishes me that the only modern author that somehow got the Gnostics was P.K. Dick in Valis &amp;ndash; but beyond that the whole argument is very convincing. There is a two-tier workforce that has started to develop different ways of thinking and covid cemented this divide; it has made the virtuals more isolated and more dependent on state fictions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
