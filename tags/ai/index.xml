I am not sure this this is the right way to frame politics (or technology or science or anything else). The active pursuit of happiness is deeply individual, and I strongly agree with Castoriadis when he claims that (in The Imaginary Institution of Society):</description></item><item><title>More failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 05:50:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing how many failed prophecies we had since the 90s. Transhumanism and Crypto are two prominent examples, but the likes of AI are not far away.
The post-soviet world is struggling to find meaning, create goals or generally go anywhere. The collective west has been living on lies for 2K years now, as Paul&amp;rsquo;s cosmic transformation is still not here, but somehow we keep going. We subside on a steady diet of propaganda, lies and half truths, fed to us by everyone who has any media access.</description></item><item><title>All is matter in motion</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 23:30:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</guid><description>Dialectics is somewhat similar to multi-agent learning (or just multi-agent systems, without any learning), possibly combined with simulation based inference (i.e. you ground the models with data). Let&amp;rsquo;s say you actually get to do the perfect simulation, you understand the all the laws of motion (i.e. the dynamics) of the system you are modelling in detail. Let&amp;rsquo;s also say you have fully uncovered every sensible variable that goes into this system.</description></item><item><title>Adversus ludii, adversus ludos</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 16:15:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</guid><description>Quick self-bio I entered AI through games; I&amp;rsquo;ve started my PhD thinking roughly that if we manage to solve poker (or more generally, games of imperfection and/or incompleteness), we will manage to more or less solve the problem of AI; solving the problem of AI meant solving the problem of labour. Nobody would have to work, because machines would do all &amp;ndash; just need to solve &amp;ldquo;the problem of games&amp;rdquo; and all we would end up doing is playing games.</description></item></channel></rss>
