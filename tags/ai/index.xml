Grant&amp;rsquo;s Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and Triumph of Christianity in the Roman World
A superb quote from the book, that links directly to how we conceive technology today is the following:
Generally speaking, technology either military or civil did not flourish in antiquity. Perhaps the existence of slavery blocked technological advance. Another cause is suggested by a story about Vespasian. Offered an invention for lifting stone columns at Rome, he rewarded the inventor but refused to use to the device, stating that he had to &amp;ldquo;feed the poor&amp;rdquo; by providing employment.</description></item><item><title>Alchemy and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 20:49:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</guid><description>There is this legendary paper by Hubert Dreyfus; it&amp;rsquo;s a critique on AI written back in 1965. Quite a bit of what is in the paper would not make sense today (as we have somewhat addressed the games and language challenges), but I think the comment that stands out is:
Alchemists were so successful in distilling quicksilver from what seemed to be dirt, that after several hundred years of fruitless effort to convert lead into gold they still re- fused to believe that on the chemical level one cannot transmute metals.</description></item><item><title>Democracy and reinforcement learning</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 16:25:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</guid><description>In the age-old battle between representative vs direct democracy, two systems stand out. In representative democracy, it seems range voting, where each candidate is given a score from 0 to 99 by each voter, has certain desirable properties. In (direct) democracy, the way Aristotle describes it in politics, no elections take place but a group of qualified candidates (which can presumably be the whole population) is subsampled randomly. The argument for random subsampling is that people tend to vote for wealthy and famous individuals, so getting someone to represent the &amp;ldquo;common man&amp;rdquo; requires drawing people in random.</description></item><item><title>Cosmic transformation and mobile phones</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/cosmotrans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 06:13:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/cosmotrans/</guid><description>Mobile phones act as a stigmatic, always on view of the world; this can be easily observed when visiting a foreign city. Getting bus routes, calling taxis and finding where to eat all become trivial. Given the amount of people that would have visited each place, there is probably a healthy amount of exploration to cover everything (and a good degree of exploitation, top tripadvisor restaurants have queues outside). The phone radically changes behaviour &amp;ndash; you no longer need to start an exploration/exploitation process everytime from scratch when you are in new place &amp;ndash; previous visitors have collectively done it for you, so you play the e-greedy game with reasonably good initial estimates.</description></item><item><title>Happiness</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/happy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 10:09:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/happy/</guid><description>There is this anecdote that John Stuart Mill used to ask adherents of certain political theories what immediate benefit they would gain if their favourite ideas were enacted. I am not sure this is the right way to frame politics (or technology or science or anything else). The active pursuit of happiness is deeply individual, and I strongly agree with Castoriadis when he claims that (in The Imaginary Institution of Society):</description></item><item><title>More failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 05:50:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing how many failed prophecies we had since the 90s. Transhumanism and Crypto are two prominent examples, but the likes of AI are not far away.
The post-soviet world is struggling to find meaning, create goals or generally go anywhere. The collective west has been living on lies for 2K years now, as Paul&amp;rsquo;s cosmic transformation is still not here, but somehow we keep going. We subside on a steady diet of propaganda, lies and half truths, fed to us by everyone who has any media access.</description></item><item><title>All is matter in motion</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 23:30:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</guid><description>Dialectics is somewhat similar to multi-agent learning (or just multi-agent systems, without any learning), possibly combined with simulation based inference (i.e. you ground the models with data). Let&amp;rsquo;s say you actually get to do the perfect simulation, you understand the all the laws of motion (i.e. the dynamics) of the system you are modelling in detail. Let&amp;rsquo;s also say you have fully uncovered every sensible variable that goes into this system.</description></item><item><title>Adversus ludii, adversus ludos</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 16:15:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</guid><description>Quick self-bio I entered AI through games; I&amp;rsquo;ve started my PhD thinking roughly that if we manage to solve poker (or more generally, games of imperfection and/or incompleteness), we will manage to more or less solve the problem of AI; solving the problem of AI meant solving the problem of labour. Nobody would have to work, because machines would do all &amp;ndash; just need to solve &amp;ldquo;the problem of games&amp;rdquo; and all we would end up doing is playing games.</description></item></channel></rss>
