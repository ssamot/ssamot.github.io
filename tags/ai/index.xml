In the SQL and regular expression front these two seem promising:

https://prql-lang.org/
One should be able to use these to make extremely explainable AI modules, something I plan on exploring in the next few month, after a finish (another) RL paper.</description></item><item><title>Idealism and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/idealism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 08:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/idealism/</guid><description>In the not so-long-ago (i.e. 10 years), it was common knowledge in AI circles that agents needed to be embedded within the world to be able to do anything useful. This proved to be harder than expected; it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to train robots to do anything, as there is a long tail of unexpected events that makes mincemeat of any concept of &amp;ldquo;abundant IID&amp;rdquo; data, and hence violates most ML algorithms basic data needs.</description></item><item><title>The refutation of all blockchains</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/bits/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 16:54:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/bits/</guid><description>Paraphrasing Irenaeus, here is a great video I discovered almost by mistake, which I think both highlights the distinction between virtual and real and kind of ends the discussion on the possibility of blockchains being of any use on authenticating anything that is not virtual.
So, in the wise words of James Hoffmann (segment starts at 00:07:46.280)
&amp;ldquo;Ooh, an issue with transparency. That&amp;rsquo;s a problem that the blockchain could solve.&amp;rdquo; No, no, you can still submit false, fraudulent information to the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Power laws</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/pareto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 13:18:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/pareto/</guid><description>Quoting Anderson, Philip W. &amp;ldquo;More is different: broken symmetry and the nature of the hierarchical structure of science.&amp;rdquo; Science 177.4047 (1972): 393-396.:
In closing, I offer two examples from economics of what I hope to have said. Marx said that quantitative differences become qualitative ones, but a dialogue in Paris in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s sums it up even more clearly: FITZGERALD: The rich are different from us. HEMINGWAY: Yes, they have more money.</description></item><item><title>Without fanaticism there is no victory</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/religion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:31:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/religion/</guid><description>One of the common tropes in Marxism (or, in fact, most forms of liberalism) is the rational organisation of society. This collective rationality ultimately stems from aggregates of individual rationality, either organised top-down or bottom up. Rationality alone does not suffice for anything it seems, not even building core tech. We need to attach some form of transcendental meaning to anything we do, even if it&amp;rsquo;s technology.</description></item><item><title>The tyranny of numbers</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/tyranny/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 20:32:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/tyranny/</guid><description>A problem I keep coming back to is one of the first things one notices when trying to analyse social science data; it is hard to come up with any concrete conclusion &amp;ndash; or, conversely, it is easy to make up any story you want, and have your data confirm it. It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to keep adding confounders and claiming that &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;, this is confounded by X, which behaves like this and that, which you did not take into account when doing the study.</description></item><item><title>Mysticism and Cybernetics</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/mysticyber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 17:09:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/mysticyber/</guid><description>I am writing a new paper on economic planning, and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to observe the kind of mystical fervour certain cybernetic themes arouse. I am not sure why, but my suspicion is that cybernetics was the last effort to do anything &amp;ldquo;AI-ish&amp;rdquo; not serving moneyed interests. We have had like 70 years since these topics were introduced, and they were all more or less incorporated in RL. Their limitations are more than obvious now.</description></item><item><title>Interim ethics and Soul Reaver 2</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/interim/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 07:15:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/interim/</guid><description>The most captivating piece of dialogue I came across in a game is between Kain and Raziel in Soul Reaver 2:
Kain : There&amp;rsquo;s a third option, a monumental secret hidden in your very presence here. But it&amp;rsquo;s a secret you have to discover for yourself. Unearth your destiny, Raziel. It&amp;rsquo;s all laid out for you here. Raziel : You said it yourself, Kain&amp;hellip; there are only two sides to your coin.</description></item><item><title>Scarcity is the scourge of freedom</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/scarcity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2022 22:59:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/scarcity/</guid><description>I came across this superb paper: Aronowitz, Stanley. “The Last Good Job in America.” Social Text, no. 51 (1997): 93–108. &amp;ndash; quoting:
&amp;hellip;among others, Robert Spiegelman, Herbert Marcuse, and Murray Bookchin have argued, scarcity is the scourge of freedom and, from the perspective of the rulers, must be artificially repro- duced to maintain the system of domination. Hence, working hours are longer, supervision-call it surveillance-more intense, accidents and injuries more frequent, and wages and salaries lower.</description></item><item><title>Experience and imagination</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/exp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 21:47:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/exp/</guid><description>There is this quote by Rob Pike of Bell Labs (of Plan 9 fame) that &amp;ldquo;Narrowness of experience leads to narrowness of imagination&amp;rdquo;, which epitomises systems thinking. Pike complains about the loss of diversity of thought in system design (everything is more or less Unix), claiming that a new generation will come that would have very narrow experiences when it comes to computing ideas. He probably accepted this as inevitable and moved on to help design GO.</description></item><item><title>Technology and labour in the Roman world</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/techlabo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 07:11:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/techlabo/</guid><description>I am reading Robert M. Grant&amp;rsquo;s Augustus to Constantine: The Rise and Triumph of Christianity in the Roman World
A superb quote from the book, that links directly to how we conceive technology today is the following:
Generally speaking, technology either military or civil did not flourish in antiquity. Perhaps the existence of slavery blocked technological advance. Another cause is suggested by a story about Vespasian. Offered an invention for lifting stone columns at Rome, he rewarded the inventor but refused to use to the device, stating that he had to &amp;ldquo;feed the poor&amp;rdquo; by providing employment.</description></item><item><title>Alchemy and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 20:49:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</guid><description>There is this legendary paper by Hubert Dreyfus; it&amp;rsquo;s a critique on AI written back in 1965. Quite a bit of what is in the paper would not make sense today (as we have somewhat addressed the games and language challenges), but I think the comment that stands out is:
Alchemists were so successful in distilling quicksilver from what seemed to be dirt, that after several hundred years of fruitless effort to convert lead into gold they still re- fused to believe that on the chemical level one cannot transmute metals.</description></item><item><title>Democracy and reinforcement learning</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 16:25:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</guid><description>In the age-old battle between representative vs direct democracy, two systems stand out. In representative democracy, it seems range voting, where each candidate is given a score from 0 to 99 by each voter, has certain desirable properties. In (direct) democracy, the way Aristotle describes it in Politics, no elections take place but a group of qualified candidates (which can presumably be the whole population) is subsampled randomly. The argument for random subsampling is that people tend to vote for wealthy and famous individuals, so getting someone to represent the &amp;ldquo;common man&amp;rdquo; requires just picking someone in random and giving them an admin post.</description></item><item><title>Cosmic transformation and mobile phones</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/cosmotrans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 06:13:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/cosmotrans/</guid><description>Mobile phones act as a stigmatic, always on view of the world; this can be easily observed when visiting a foreign city. Getting bus routes, calling taxis and finding where to eat all become trivial. Given the amount of people that would have visited each place, there is probably a healthy amount of exploration to cover everything (and a good degree of exploitation, top tripadvisor restaurants have queues outside). The phone radically changes behaviour &amp;ndash; you no longer need to start an exploration/exploitation process everytime from scratch when you are in new place &amp;ndash; previous visitors have collectively done it for you, so you play the e-greedy game with reasonably good initial estimates.</description></item><item><title>Happiness</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/happy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 10:09:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/happy/</guid><description>There is this anecdote that John Stuart Mill used to ask adherents of certain political theories what immediate benefit they would gain if their favourite ideas were enacted. I am not sure this is the right way to frame politics (or technology or science or anything else). The active pursuit of happiness is deeply individual, and I strongly agree with Castoriadis when he claims that (in The Imaginary Institution of Society):</description></item><item><title>More failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 05:50:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/morefailure/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing how many failed prophecies we had since the 90s. Transhumanism and Crypto are two prominent examples, but the likes of AI are not far away.
The post-soviet world is struggling to find meaning, create goals or generally go anywhere. The collective west has been living on lies for 2K years now, as Paul&amp;rsquo;s cosmic transformation is still not here, but somehow we keep going. We subside on a steady diet of propaganda, lies and half truths, fed to us by everyone who has any media access.</description></item><item><title>All is matter in motion</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 23:30:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/matter/</guid><description>Dialectics is somewhat similar to multi-agent learning (or just multi-agent systems, without any learning), possibly combined with simulation based inference (i.e. you ground the models with data). Let&amp;rsquo;s say you actually get to do the perfect simulation, you understand the all the laws of motion (i.e. the dynamics) of the system you are modelling in detail. Let&amp;rsquo;s also say you have fully uncovered every sensible variable that goes into this system.</description></item><item><title>Adversus ludii, adversus ludos</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 16:15:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</guid><description>Quick self-bio I entered AI through games; I&amp;rsquo;ve started my PhD thinking roughly that if we manage to solve poker (or more generally, games of imperfection and/or incompleteness), we will manage to more or less solve the problem of AI; solving the problem of AI meant solving the problem of labour. Nobody would have to work, because machines would do all &amp;ndash; just need to solve &amp;ldquo;the problem of games&amp;rdquo; and all we would end up doing is playing games.</description></item></channel></rss>
