&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Technique has penetrated the deepest recesses of the human being. The machine tends not only to create a new human environment, but also to modify man&amp;rsquo;s very essence. The milieu in which he lives is no longer his. He must adapt himself, as though the world were new, to a universe for which he was not created. He was made to go six kilometers an hour, and he goes a thousand. He was made to eat when he was hungry and to sleep when he was sleepy; instead, he obeys a clock. He was made to have contact with living things, and he lives in a world of stone. He was created with a certain essential unity, and he is fragmented by all the forces of the modern world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Liberal contradictions</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/contraliber/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 10:07:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/contraliber/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite often it seems to me that the modern left (of the liberal sort) has lost its ways completely.

(2004). The culture of make believe. Chelsea Green Publishing.&lt;/a> is a rather bizarre book (in the sense that it often reads as random thoughts put on a paper), in the anarcho-primitivist tradition, that more or less equates civilisation (&amp;ldquo;the dominant culture&amp;rdquo;) with an algorithm that is hell-bend on dominating everything and treats the living as means to an end, as objects. In other words, our culture is in a permanent state of sin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ERPs, LLMs, resource planning and cybersyn</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/erp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 10:18:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/erp/</guid><description>&lt;p>There has been quite a lot written about cybersyn, and more is to come, but its technological promise IMHO has been achieved years ago. Every manufacturing company has an automated inventory recording system, almost all needs are calculated daily, orders are put forward and control is performed centrally. Add LLMs to the mix and we really have the &amp;ldquo;heart of the enterprise&amp;rdquo;. We have an entity that can communicate to the external world in a easy way and tries to expand aggressively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Financially broke elites and moral superiority</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ll/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 18:23:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ll/</guid><description>&lt;p>Combing through right-wing forums (yes, 4chans and youtubes), one can find a very strange take, where there is a claim that apparently modern liberal elites are penniless, but that does not somehow stop them from being elite! Young university graduates, most of whom have to work in some of the most meaningless and boring jobs known to man in a depressing corporate department, and who will never be able to afford a mortgage, are the actual decision makers of this world. Apparently their basic worldview is a form of &amp;ldquo;ultra-progressivism&amp;rdquo;, a self-hating anomaly that wants to change the morals of western societies (akin to how early Christians took over Rome). The argument as to how university graduates can even be perceived as elite (not as a semi-homeless, over-debted, lied-to underclass) is one drawn from moral superiority and culture. They eat somewhat different foods than the generation before them and make anti-imperial claims (that are never related to what is going on now, but some event that took place 100 years ago).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Losing your ethical core</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ethicalcore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 17:50:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ethicalcore/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going back to &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/against-the-protestant-gnostics-9780195084368">Against the Protestant Gnostics&lt;/a>, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking that the collapse of mainline US Christianity takes place more or less at the same time as soviet collapse (late 80s). Quoting Zhivkov, the last Bulgarian communist leader: &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/marxism-is-bunk-says-exdictator-1.90868">&amp;ldquo;In my memoirs I am smashing the whole of Marxist theory. Marxism is mere nonsense and I am the first one to say that it is completely wrong&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. Both socialism and progressive liberalism lost their moral core, they became empty husks and mechanisms for people to accumulate power. The parallels here might be quite strong and point to a failure by adherents of &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711630">semisecularized postmillennialism&lt;/a> to maintain belief; the Kingdom of God is no longer to progressively come through a constant improvement of living standards (or anything else). Both progressive liberals and ex-soviets stopped believing in anything and started directly worshipping capital, a form of demiurgic worship &amp;ndash; archons and all. Something will have to fill the gap left behind by the collapse of the dominant modern narrative, and it&amp;rsquo;s still not clear what that would be or when it will come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protestants, gnostics and modern marxists</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/prognostic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 08:05:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/prognostic/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/against-the-protestant-gnostics-9780195084368">Against the Protestant Gnostics&lt;/a> is a fascinating read. From &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete">Irenaeus&lt;/a> onwards, whomever mainstream Christians do not like they label gnostic, but at the very least the author of this book goes into great lengths to support his position. Unlike Irenaeus, who delves deep into Gnostic mythology and cosmology, the author of &amp;ldquo;Against the Protestant Gnostics&amp;rdquo; uses the bible as source material. He sees the extreme individualisation and lack of community as the modern cardinal sin, very much in line with &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38212112-the-culture-of-narcissism">Christopher Lasch&lt;/a>. Secondary issues include a strong preference on personal revelation, an excessive focus on knowledge (though I doubt that&amp;rsquo;s the knowledge the Gnostics were taking about), a disdain for this world, elitism, and the surrender of evangelical protestantism to capitalism. I would not have attributed all the above to gnostics; indeed the New Testament (exp. John and Paul), as the author accepts, is full of these and the Church fathers are no better. For example Irenaeus himself blames living among the barbaric Celts for his lack of oratory skills (tiny bit elitist?).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The ends do not justify the means</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 13:53:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ends/</guid><description>&lt;p>I find that the whole premise of the lord of the rings is that should you cause greater suffering to achieve some greater good, you end up with some form of greater evil &amp;ndash; the prime modern example being &lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300104073/the-road-to-terror/">The Road to Terror Stalin and the Self-Destruction of the Bolsheviks, 1932-1939&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The antidote to this is slow, gradual, well thought-out movement. You introduce changes bit-by-bit, salami tacticing the problems you face as much as possible and moving the consensus. It&amp;rsquo;s not fancy, but it&amp;rsquo;s stable and brings results; in topics that are of interest to me, like moving to a fully planned economy (or introducing any big-data-social-improvement project) violently moving forward will end in tears &amp;ndash; one would start with social-democratic solutions to alleviate problems here and now and then introduce novelty gradually enterprise by enterprise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Marx and family</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/marxf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 13:57:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/marxf/</guid><description>&lt;p>Same quick quotes from &lt;a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1890/xx/marx.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1890/xx/marx.htm&lt;/a> on Marx and family&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He had a great talent for languages which his daughters inherited from him. He took up the study of Russian when he was already 50 years old, and although that language had no close affinity to any of the modern or ancient languages he knew, in six months he knew it well enough to derive pleasure from reading Russian poets and prose writers, his preference going to Pushkin, Gogol and Shchedrin&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Culture and societal transformations</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/culture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 09:59:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2022/09/15/why-we-failed-to-approve-the-new-chilean-constitution/#author-info">Why we failed to approve the new Chilean constitution: the need for a cultural transformation&lt;/a> this morning while browsing twitter.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I cannot stop thinking about Pepe Mujica’s sentence in his documentary, “the most important transformation is not political, but cultural.” We failed to approve the new constitution because we haven’t addressed the need for a cultural transformation that would allow us to negotiate a new set of values with one another. The proposed new constitution was based on values such as solidarity, ecocentrism, probity, good governance, and territorial autonomy, which seem far from something that the majority of voters could agree on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power laws</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/pareto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 13:18:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/pareto/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quoting &lt;a href="https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf">Anderson, Philip W. &amp;ldquo;More is different: broken symmetry and the nature of the hierarchical structure of science.&amp;rdquo; Science 177.4047 (1972): 393-396.&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In closing, I offer two examples from
economics of what I hope to have said.
Marx said that quantitative differences
become qualitative ones, but a dialogue
in Paris in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s sums it up even
more clearly:
FITZGERALD: The rich are different from us.
HEMINGWAY: Yes, they have more
money.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The tyranny of numbers</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/tyranny/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 20:32:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/tyranny/</guid><description>&lt;p>A problem I keep coming back to is one of the first things one notices when trying to analyse social science data; it is hard to come up with any concrete conclusion &amp;ndash; or, conversely, it is easy to make up any story you want, and have your data confirm it. It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to keep adding confounders and claiming that &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;, this is confounded by X, which behaves like this and that, which you did not take into account when doing the study. In the same vein, one can selectively ignore confounders, present the right data (i.e. &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How_to_Lie_with_Statistics">How to Lie with Statistics&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1651073.The_Tyranny_of_Numbers">The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule&lt;/a>) and make it deliver whatever you want to deliver. At this point, what even counts as inference? It&amp;rsquo;s all made up, a theology of sorts on top of latent variables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sinking ships and the wheel of history</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ships/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 07:22:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ships/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chappo trap house is reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3062-first-class-passengers-on-a-sinking-ship">Lachmann, Richard.

There is one arrow of time, and that is one of more liberalism, i.e. more market as the solution to everything, no other thoughts needed. Yet the tide is turning, and has been turning for a number of years, but without much in the process of actual results. You can find anti-market rhetoric coming from everywhere in the political spectrum (see here &lt;a href="https://unherd.com/2022/07/britain-needs-macmillan-not-thatcher/%29">https://unherd.com/2022/07/britain-needs-macmillan-not-thatcher/)&lt;/a>, but no real intervention gets in motion. We see the &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; investing more and more on absurd products (insta-remote-shopping (?!)), while neglecting anything of value, but forces-that-be accept it as part of the natural order of things (kind of like gravity), nothing can be done about it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
