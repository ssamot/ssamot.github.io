&lt;p>The idea that complex social problems are amenable to cheap technical solutions is the siren
song of the software salesman and has lured many a gullible government department on to
the rocks. Where ministers buy the idea of a magical software ‘solution’, as the industry likes
to call its products, the outcomes are often disappointing and sometimes disastrous. And the
very idea that we can replace police officers, social workers and teachers by ordering
Facebook to watch our children and grandchildren more closely is a non-starter. The kids left
Facebook years ago for Instagram; they’re now headed via Snapchat to TikTok, and to an
assortment of gaming platforms.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
