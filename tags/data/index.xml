It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to keep adding confounders and claiming that &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;, this is confounded by X, which behaves like this and that, which you did not take into account when doing the study. In the same vein, one can selectively ignore confounders, present the right data (i.e. &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How_to_Lie_with_Statistics"&gt;How to Lie with Statistics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1651073.The_Tyranny_of_Numbers"&gt;The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule&lt;/a&gt;) and make it deliver whatever you want to deliver. At this point, what even counts as inference? It&amp;rsquo;s all made up, a theology of sorts on top of latent variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
