&lt;p&gt;So, in the wise words of James Hoffmann (segment starts at 00:07:46.280)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ooh, an issue with transparency. That&amp;rsquo;s a problem that the
blockchain could solve.&amp;rdquo;
No, no, you can still submit
false, fraudulent information
to the blockchain.
And all you&amp;rsquo;re doing is
writing with a very permanent,
very wasteful marker into the ledger.
In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that it
would probably enable fraud
by giving a kind of veneer of authenticity
to a fraudulent product.
So please, no blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
