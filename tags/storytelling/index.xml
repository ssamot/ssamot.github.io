&lt;li>A character is in a zone of comfort,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But they want something.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They enter an unfamiliar situation,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adapt to it,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get what they wanted,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pay a heavy price for it,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then return to their familiar situation,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having changed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I am not that comfortable with this as the basic arc of life, it involves way too much luck, and can only work in a stable world where you can try and fail as many times as you like. I wonder if there is a book of stories (something like &lt;a href="https://enginepublishing.com/eureka-501-adventure-plots-to-inspire-game-masters">Eureka&lt;/a>) where this arc is followed, but the hero fails miserably along the path. E.g. you can fail at point 4, failing to adapt to an unfamiliar situation. Point 5 is a nice place to fail as well, you adapt but you get nothing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
