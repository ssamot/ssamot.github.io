In representative democracy, it seems &lt;a href="https://rangevoting.org/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/rangevote.pdf"&gt;range voting&lt;/a&gt;, where each candidate is given a score from 0 to 99 by each voter, has certain desirable properties. In (direct) democracy, the way Aristotle describes it in &lt;a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html"&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt;, no elections take place but a group of qualified candidates (which can presumably be the whole population) is subsampled randomly. The argument for random subsampling is that people tend to vote for wealthy and famous individuals, so getting someone to represent the &amp;ldquo;common man&amp;rdquo; requires just picking someone in random and giving them an admin post.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
