There is a table in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/593608.Isaac_Newton"&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/593608.Isaac_Newton&lt;/a&gt;, a biography of Newton which I read almost 20 years ago, which summarises Neuton&amp;rsquo;s prophecies. They were apparently derived from a close reading of the Bible, and not by any form of revelation. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me how he came up with these dates, or if the table has any validity at all. Another set of dates is reported here: &lt;a href="https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/cjh_newton_03.pdf"&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/cjh_newton_03.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, with the Kingdom of God arriving at 2060 &amp;ndash; not sure how this fits with the dates in the table below nor do I get why and how the prophecies of Daniel play up with Revelations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 14:14:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sanctify-them-in-the-truth-john-1717"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth&amp;rdquo; (John 17:17)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla (the car business) recently published a video of its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0z4FweCy4M"&gt;AI day&lt;/a&gt; giving a tour de force of modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. From monte carlo tree search to simulation-based reasoning, Tesla is throwing every modern technique to the problem of self driving cars, coupled with possibly some of the best research scientists and engineers in the business. Yet, somehow, this is not enough; as another &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfharlIQ2qE"&gt;video mocking Tesla&lt;/a&gt; for its inability to produce a self-driving car points out, the promise of real-world AI delivering anything that would resemble its science fiction counterpart is astoundingly far. The likes of self-driving cars, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musks-open-source-openai-were-working-on-a-robot-that-will-do-your-household-chores/"&gt;robotic maids and butlers&lt;/a&gt;, robotic farm work, &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2016153/ai-promised-to-revolutionize-radiology-but-so-far-its-failing/"&gt;automated medical doctors&lt;/a&gt;, robotic you-name-it are currently a pipe dream, and might remain so for the ages (more on this later). Tesla operates within the mantle of extreme technological optimism, an almost default positions given the level of change the world has seen since the industrial revolution. This level of optimism is not unique to Tesla &amp;ndash; the techno-social landscape has been a source of unparalleled optimism across the political spectrum. Living in a world without progress is beyond our ability even contemplate, but this might be exactly what we might be facing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
