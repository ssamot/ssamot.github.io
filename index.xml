I have no idea what they plan to do with it (most people&amp;rsquo;s lives are super boring, what kind of political dissent are they looking for?), but Briar, Matrix and Signal seem reasonable, sane alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Failed prophecies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 14:14:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/world/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth&amp;rdquo; (John 17:17) Tesla (the car business) recently published a video of its AI day giving a tour de force of modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. From monte carlo tree search to simulation-based reasoning, Tesla is throwing every modern technique to the problem of self driving cars, coupled with possibly some of the best research scientists and engineers in the business. Yet, somehow, this is not enough; as another video mocking Tesla for its inability to produce a self-driving car points out, the promise of real-world AI delivering anything that would resemble its science fiction counterpart is astoundingly far.</description></item><item><title>Moving to Hugo</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 12:28:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my personal website to Hugo.

My research focuses on broader AI themes; I&amp;rsquo;ve started as a game AI researcher, but my interests have since drifted towards out-of-distribution generalisation, robustness and causal inference, though I still maintain a healthy passion for games. I also enjoy thinking how to build new societal institutions and have a general fascination with religion. I am a big fan of tabletop role playing games (Shadowrun, D&amp;amp;D, Warhammer, Mage the Ascension).</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ssamot.me/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/contact/</guid><description>For work related stuff you can e-mail me at my UoE address, for anything personal feel free to contact me at my personal address.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://ssamot.me/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/publications/</guid><description>You can find most of my (academic) publications under my Google scholar profile.</description></item></channel></rss>
