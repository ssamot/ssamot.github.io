In an article termed <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/nr.1999.3.1.60>When Prophecy Fails and Faith Persists: A Theoretical Overview</a>, one can read the same lesson we find in Kuhn&rsquo;s scientific revolutions book. It&rsquo;s hard for people to change their minds, and religious movements that fail to predict the future can thrive as long as they keep proselytising. Quoting:</p><blockquote><p>The resilience displayed by religious groups in the face of prophetic
failures suggests, as several commentators have argued, that the level
of dissonance experienced by insiders is less than that imagined by
outsiders, particularly social scientific researchers with their greater
personal and professional commitment to logical consistency.76 In the
simple and poignant words of Snow and Machalek, â€œUnlike belief in
science, many belief systems do not require consistent and frequent
confirmatory evidence. Beliefs may withstand the pressure of
disconfirming events not because of the effectiveness of dissonancereducing strategies, but because disconfirming evidence may simply go
unacknowledged.</p></blockquote><p>In sort, you can keep marketing an idea long after it has clearly failed. Kuhn, in <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61539.The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a> makes a similar observation (quoting Planck):</p><blockquote><p>An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning: another instance of the fact that the future lies with the youth</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s hard to change our faiths. Which kind of begs the question: what if scientists start doing the evangelism of marketeers and religious leaders? You would probably get stuck in the lies of the past, and new truths would never find their way.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/religion>Religion</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div class=footer-info><a href=https://twitter.com/spysamot/>Twitter</a>
