It also has very little to do with the argument the book is bringing forward, which is that we have two modes of thinking (i.e. dual-process theory), a fast &ldquo;quick intuitive&rdquo; vs a slow &ldquo;deep thinking&rdquo;. Dual process theory is nicely abstracted in what I would now consider a classic reinforcement learning article termed

You have to have some irrational, made up beliefs to anchor your decisions on, a narrative of some kind that would help you make sense of your sensory input. I can easily imagine a situation where such beliefs are reinforced through communal language and ritualistic affirmations as part of some positive feedback loop. The interesting question is what it takes to create such a loop and how to go about replacing/changing broken loops.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/artificial-intelligence>Artificial Intelligence</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div class=footer-info><a href=https://twitter.com/spysamot/>Twitter</a>
