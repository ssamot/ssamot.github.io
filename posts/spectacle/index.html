Transhumanism was to play the same role in the modern world, but it had died a horrible death. It is now rather clear I think that technologies that are to radically change the human condition (beyond methods of social engineering) lie beyond this century. No eminent end of history (again).</p><blockquote><p>The monotheistic religions were a compromise between myth and history, between the cyclical time that still
governed the sphere of production and the irreversible time that was the theater of conflicts and regroupings
among different peoples. The religions that evolved out of Judaism were abstract universal acknowledgments of
an irreversible time that had become democratized and open to all, but only in the realm of illusion. Time is
totally oriented toward a single final event: “The Kingdom of God is soon to come.” These religions were rooted
in the soil of history, but they remained radically opposed to history. The semihistorical religions establish a
qualitative point of departure in time (the birth of Christ, the flight of Mohammed), but their irreversible time —
introducing an accumulation that would take the form of conquest in Islam and of increasing capital in
Reformation Christianity — is inverted in religious thought and becomes a sort of countdown: waiting for time to
run out before the Last Judgment and the advent of the other, true world. Eternity has emerged from cyclical
time, as something beyond it. It is also the element that restrains the irreversibility of time, suppressing history
within history itself by positioning itself on the other side of irreversible time as a pure point into which cyclical
time returns and disappears. Bossuet will still say: “By way of time, which passes, we enter eternity, which does
not pass.”</p></blockquote></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/marxism>Marxism</a></li><li><a href=/tags/></a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div class=footer-info><a href=https://twitter.com/spysamot/>Twitter</a>
