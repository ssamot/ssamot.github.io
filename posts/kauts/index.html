As a start, one can take <a href=https://www.marxists.org/history/international/social-democracy/1891/erfurt-program.htm>the Erfurt programme</a> and start doing a formal/data science analysis on each constituent part of the programme. I&rsquo;ve broken down the programme demands into categories and re-organised them so as as to make each demand more specific and explicit. Next to each demand I have included a relevant research question, plus whether or not the demand is currently met in the &ldquo;broader&rdquo; west.</p><p>As one might expect, the first set of demands is around universal suffrage:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Suffrage demands</th><th style=text-align:left>Research question</th><th style=text-align:left>Currently in place</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Universal, equal, and direct suffrage with secret ballot in all elections, for all citizens of the Reich over the age of twenty, without distinction of sex.</td><td style=text-align:left>What is the ideal voting age?</td><td style=text-align:left><span style=color:green>yes</span></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Proportional representation, and, until this is introduced, legal redistribution of electoral districts after every census.</td><td style=text-align:left>What kind of voting system?</td><td style=text-align:left><span style=color:red>no</span></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Two-year legislative periods.

I think they have been largely achieved in the west.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Religious demands</th><th style=text-align:left>Research question</th><th style=text-align:left>Currently in place</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Declaration that religion is a private matter.</td><td style=text-align:left>What should be our take on proselytising?</td><td style=text-align:left><span style=color:green>yes</span></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Abolition of all expenditures from public funds for ecclesiastical and religious purposes.</td><td style=text-align:left>Can they be voted back in?</td><td style=text-align:left><span style=color:green>yes</span></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Ecclesiastical and religious communities are to be regarded as private associations that regulate their affairs entirely autonomously.</td><td style=text-align:left>Should they be tax-exempt?</td><td style=text-align:left><span style=color:green>yes</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The sixth set of demands is around education:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Educational demands</th><th style=text-align:left>Research question</th><th style=text-align:left>Currently in place</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Secularization of schools.

In future posts I will address each group of demands in more detail, complement the demands and setup adversaries, i.e. what lobby groups would be against them.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/socialism>Socialism</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div class=footer-info><a href=https://twitter.com/spysamot/>Twitter</a>
