The machine tends not only to create a new human environment, but also to modify man&rsquo;s very essence. The milieu in which he lives is no longer his. He must adapt himself, as though the world were new, to a universe for which he was not created. He was made to go six kilometers an hour, and he goes a thousand. He was made to eat when he was hungry and to sleep when he was sleepy; instead, he obeys a clock. He was made to have contact with living things, and he lives in a world of stone. He was created with a certain essential unity, and he is fragmented by all the forces of the modern world.</p></blockquote><p>But why? Why would we reconfigure the environment around us to such an extent so to make life unbearable? I do not think the answer is that hard &ndash; it&rsquo;s because it was not that good to begin with. Anti-tech proponents often portray the pre-enlightenment world as a lost paradise; man knew his place in nature, laws were given by the Gods. I am not sure how they come to this conclusion, every religion seems to point to a deeply flawed creation -to the extent that world religions do express some kind gestalt about humanity, I would guess this is how humanity has always felt.</p><p>But I am not sure, however, this was Ellul&rsquo;s message. We yearn for technologies that can be autonomous outside the Anthropocene, where one can manipulate nature without destroying it; i.e. producing without factories, travelling without roads, eating easily accessible food without industrial agriculture. Keep the world the same, complete the human.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/politics>Politics</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div class=footer-info><a href=https://twitter.com/spysamot/>Twitter</a>
