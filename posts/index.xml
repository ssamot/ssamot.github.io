&lt;p>I am getting back my passion for sci-fi novels (gradually&amp;hellip;) and starting reading more Shadowrun stuff. The Earthdown/Shadowrun cross-over is superb, and points to a comment I discovered in reddit some time ago on why Shadowrun tech feels different. The timelines of the main players are measured in millennia (vs six months), and that allows them to do long term thinking (and hence deep research).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alpha Go Zero and sample efficiency</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/alphago/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 12:49:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/alphago/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am having a re-read of the original alpha-go zero paper here: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the course of training, 4.9 million games of self-play were generated, using 1,600 simulations for each MCTS, which corresponds to approximately 0.4s thinking time per move. Parameters were updated from 700,000 mini-batches of 2,048 positions. The neural network contained 20 residual blocks (see Methods for further details)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The amount of compute used seems on the low side (even if you account for the fact that this is a &amp;ldquo;nested&amp;rdquo; algorithm, with simulations within simulations) compared to the monstrosities we use for LLMs &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s 7 years ago! Still, sample efficiency would need to be improved massively before RL becomes relevant to situations where the model is not available or cannot be learned, and my suspicion is that this is not an RL problem, but a supervised learning problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transactions</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/transactions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 08:43:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/transactions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got across this list of 4 blog posts that describe ancient religion as a form of black box technology, with the inner mechanisms being latent.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea that complex social problems are amenable to cheap technical solutions is the siren
song of the software salesman and has lured many a gullible government department on to
the rocks. Where ministers buy the idea of a magical software ‘solution’, as the industry likes
to call its products, the outcomes are often disappointing and sometimes disastrous. And the
very idea that we can replace police officers, social workers and teachers by ordering
Facebook to watch our children and grandchildren more closely is a non-starter. The kids left
Facebook years ago for Instagram; they’re now headed via Snapchat to TikTok, and to an
assortment of gaming platforms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Celsus, Porphyry, Julian</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/jpc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 20:04:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/jpc/</guid><description>&lt;p>An interesting aspect of the anti-Christian polemic these three philosophers have authored is that all of them seem to have a henotheistic take on religion, but differ on the validity of the Christian teachings. Julian, being the last in line, more or less claims that if you only read Christian works, you will end acting like a slave, whereas if you complement your education with Graeco(-Roman) classics you should be able to appreciate the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey (or that&amp;rsquo;s how I read it at least). Celsus seems to despise the slave element, but I guess Julian thinks there is something valuable there, which shows some kind of transformation taking place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presentation</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/presentation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 16:39:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/presentation/</guid><description>&lt;p>An hour long presentation on &lt;a href="https://ssamot.me/phil.comp.pdf">AI and planning&lt;/a> by yours truly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadowrun</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/shadowrun/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 10:54:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/shadowrun/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;figure class="floatleft">&lt;img src="https://ssamot.me/shadowrun.jpeg"

 Shadowrun (the game) can be read as wish for vengeance against colonizers. There are means to manipulate the world that do not have their origins in European thought (i.e. science, technology) and can deliver mega-violence. Some kind of response to Toledo steel, the machine gun and the atom bomb; it invariably involves spirits (e.g. the great ghost dance) or some other form of magic. Nature literally fights back and indigenous tribes now have means to down helicopters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alienation</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/alienation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 16:14:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/alienation/</guid><description>&lt;p>If Marx&amp;rsquo;s all-important quote is the one on the opium of the people, Ellul&amp;rsquo;s comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/266493-la-technique-ou-l-enjeu-du-si-cle">The Technological Society&lt;/a> and is:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Technique has penetrated the deepest recesses of the human being. The machine tends not only to create a new human environment, but also to modify man&amp;rsquo;s very essence. The milieu in which he lives is no longer his. He must adapt himself, as though the world were new, to a universe for which he was not created. He was made to go six kilometers an hour, and he goes a thousand. He was made to eat when he was hungry and to sleep when he was sleepy; instead, he obeys a clock. He was made to have contact with living things, and he lives in a world of stone. He was created with a certain essential unity, and he is fragmented by all the forces of the modern world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Books and movies</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/booksmovies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 20:35:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/booksmovies/</guid><description>&lt;p>A set of books and movies that have certain parallels I found interesting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you feel about this. I think this prospect is absolutely horrible. I think it is worth sacrificing almost anything to avoid this future, which would make Stasi and Big Brother blush. Luckily, in my estimate we don&amp;rsquo;t need to sacrifice anything, because there is no credible existential threat from AI. It is all figments of the hyperactive imaginations of some people, boosted by certain corporations who develop AI models and stand to win from regulating away their competition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Games of strict competition and process theology</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/strictcomp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 06:45:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/strictcomp/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A strange game.

&lt;p>For now, it is worth noting that automation can’t solve the necessary labor problem because (a) some kinds of necessary labor, like education and health care and childcare, cannot be fully automated; (b) some kinds of necessary labor, from construction to agriculture, might in principle be fully automatable but not in the near or even moderate-distance future; (c) many kinds of automation eliminate some tasks but create new ones that require human beings; and (d) machines have to be monitored and repaired, so even where machines do fully replace human beings, the necessary labor of maintenance remains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ellul</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ellul/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 19:46:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ellul/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quoting from &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1362676">Ellul&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The New Demons&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The remarkable thing is that, &amp;ldquo;while excluding the
existence, the essence, the name and the reality of God, Jainism
and Buddhism very soon become authentic religions.&amp;rdquo; The
religionizing power is so strong that Christianity (which I am
deeply convinced is antireligious) is finally engulfed and is progres­
sively transformed into a religion. Then the movement of scientific
rationalism, extended by Marxist, materialistic rationalism, winds
up recreating the religious in the world. Religion even inserts itself
into militant atheism. Marx, in his famous passage in German
Ideology, longed to see the disappearance of atheism at the same
time as that of religion. Moreover, it is common knowledge that, in
his view, Voltaire&amp;rsquo;s anti-Christianity was nothing but a form of
religion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thinking fast and slow</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/thinkingfast/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 20:49:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/thinkingfast/</guid><description>&lt;p>So in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11468377">Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a>, two modes of thinking are proposed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A fast mode of thinking, akin to having learned Q-values and executing them, i.e. have more or less developed a really good reflex on what to do in every situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A slow and deliberate mode of thinking, where one refines his knowledge by thinking more (i.e doing some kind of model-based RL in their heads).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>At the very least this is the RL-like interpretation I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people commonly discuss, e.g. see here: &lt;a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/d8e1344e27a5b08cdfd5d027d9b8d6de-Abstract.html">Thinking fast and slow with deep learning and tree search&lt;/a>. I am pretty confident that some kind of heuristic is involved (maybe in the form of reward shaping) that makes most games trivial. Every game has one, and it operates outside the rules of the game through analogies, on some other symbolic space that makes sense only to humans. One can think of this as some sort of hidden context which, if revealed, makes the game trivial. Maybe LLMs can provide this context?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spectacle and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/spectacleai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 23:42:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/spectacleai/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going back to Guy Debord&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle">The Society of the Spectacle&lt;/a>, first aphorism, we read:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; , Unabomber manifesto &amp;ndash; the whole book praises universal value functions and model free RL (vs model based stuff).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;We see through the mirror, darkly&amp;rdquo;, Paul in Corinthians I, 13 &amp;ndash; the quote is followed by a passage that discusses that at some point we will stop just receiving observations and the real world state will be revealed to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Man makes his world, or is crushed by the world made by others&amp;rdquo;, quoted in Mage 2nd edition core rulebook, originally by Denning &amp;amp; Phillips, the foundations of high magick &amp;ndash; which points to the importance of mental representations on reward and the zero-sum games they create.&lt;/li>

Young university graduates, most of whom have to work in some of the most meaningless and boring jobs known to man in a depressing corporate department, and who will never be able to afford a mortgage, are the actual decision makers of this world. Apparently their basic worldview is a form of &amp;ldquo;ultra-progressivism&amp;rdquo;, a self-hating anomaly that wants to change the morals of western societies (akin to how early Christians took over Rome). The argument as to how university graduates can even be perceived as elite (not as a semi-homeless, over-debted, lied-to underclass) is one drawn from moral superiority and culture. They eat somewhat different foods than the generation before them and make anti-imperial claims (that are never related to what is going on now, but some event that took place 100 years ago).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The manifold hypothesis and text</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/manifolods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 07:50:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/manifolods/</guid><description>&lt;p>ChatGPT (and most GPT-like services) make up stuff all the time &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not that surprising, and should not be that hard to fix.

(b) We will reveal the cruelty and moral decay of the elites (or the system they support) to everyone
(c) All will see how morally bankrupt the elites are and hence start some form of active resistance

&lt;p>I am not that comfortable with this as the basic arc of life, it involves way too much luck, and can only work in a stable world where you can try and fail as many times as you like.

&lt;p>If God asked you before the creation of the universe if you would agree to be part of a world that was not certain to be saved—where there was real adventure and real risk—what would you say? James recognizes that a world where the risk of failure is real does not appeal to everyone; but he says that the chances for success that it promises brings zest to life and makes it rational to, “add our fiat to the fiat of the creator” (James 1907, 290–291)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bayes vs machine learning</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/oot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:22:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/oot/</guid><description>&lt;p>The classic exposition of current trends in AI is captured nicely here: &lt;a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Summing up,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No non-overlapping magisteria</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/nonover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:12:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/nonover/</guid><description>&lt;p>So today being the day/date it is, it might be worth posting one of Mark Fisher&amp;rsquo;s lectures.&lt;/p>

From &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete">Irenaeus&lt;/a> onwards, whomever mainstream Christians do not like they label gnostic, but at the very least the author of this book goes into great lengths to support his position. Unlike Irenaeus, who delves deep into Gnostic mythology and cosmology, the author of &amp;ldquo;Against the Protestant Gnostics&amp;rdquo; uses the bible as source material. He sees the extreme individualisation and lack of community as the modern cardinal sin, very much in line with &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38212112-the-culture-of-narcissism">Christopher Lasch&lt;/a>. Secondary issues include a strong preference on personal revelation, an excessive focus on knowledge (though I doubt that&amp;rsquo;s the knowledge the Gnostics were taking about), a disdain for this world, elitism, and the surrender of evangelical protestantism to capitalism. I would not have attributed all the above to gnostics; indeed the New Testament (exp. John and Paul), as the author accepts, is full of these and the Church fathers are no better. For example Irenaeus himself blames living among the barbaric Celts for his lack of oratory skills (tiny bit elitist?).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Idealism and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/idealism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 08:50:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/idealism/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the not so-long-ago (i.e. 10 years), it was common knowledge in AI circles that agents needed to be embedded within the world to be able to do anything useful.

The Cartesian understanding would have brain/mind breaking the procedure of observing hand-waving in two separate parts: one observing arms flaying around and one transforming this movement into a &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; representation in the brain. Any gesture recognition software has this knowledge baked in. Now, what is being argued by the author is that this processing pathway does not exist &amp;ndash; we see &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; &lt;em>directly&lt;/em>.

This collective rationality ultimately stems from aggregates of individual rationality, either organised top-down or bottom up. Rationality alone does not suffice for anything it seems, not even building core tech. We need to attach some form of transcendental meaning to anything we do, even if it&amp;rsquo;s technology.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s trivial to keep adding confounders and claiming that &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;, this is confounded by X, which behaves like this and that, which you did not take into account when doing the study. In the same vein, one can selectively ignore confounders, present the right data (i.e. &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51291.How_to_Lie_with_Statistics">How to Lie with Statistics&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1651073.The_Tyranny_of_Numbers">The Tyranny of Numbers: Mismeasurement and Misrule&lt;/a>) and make it deliver whatever you want to deliver.

&lt;p>A superb quote from the book, that links directly to how we conceive technology today is the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Generally speaking, technology either military or civil did not flourish in antiquity. Perhaps the existence of slavery blocked technological advance. Another cause is suggested by a story about Vespasian. Offered an invention for lifting stone columns at Rome, he rewarded the inventor but refused to use the device, stating that he had to &amp;ldquo;feed the poor&amp;rdquo; by providing employment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blind faith</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/faith/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 09:29:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/faith/</guid><description>&lt;p>Religious studies have a quite a lot to say on the world around us, and progress more specifically. In an article termed &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/nr.1999.3.1.60">When Prophecy Fails and Faith Persists: A Theoretical Overview&lt;/a>, one can read the same lesson we find in Kuhn&amp;rsquo;s scientific revolutions book. It&amp;rsquo;s hard for people to change their minds, and religious movements that fail to predict the future can thrive as long as they keep proselytising. Quoting:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The resilience displayed by religious groups in the face of prophetic
failures suggests, as several commentators have argued, that the level
of dissonance experienced by insiders is less than that imagined by
outsiders, particularly social scientific researchers with their greater
personal and professional commitment to logical consistency.76 In the
simple and poignant words of Snow and Machalek, “Unlike belief in
science, many belief systems do not require consistent and frequent
confirmatory evidence. Beliefs may withstand the pressure of
disconfirming events not because of the effectiveness of dissonancereducing strategies, but because disconfirming evidence may simply go
unacknowledged.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alchemy and AI</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 20:49:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/alch/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is this &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2006/P3244.pdf">legendary paper by Hubert Dreyfus&lt;/a>; it&amp;rsquo;s a critique on AI written back in 1965. Quite a bit of what is in the paper would not make sense today (as we have somewhat addressed the games and language challenges), but I think the comment that stands out is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Alchemists were so successful in distilling quicksilver
from what seemed to be dirt, that after several hundred years
of fruitless effort to convert lead into gold they still re-
fused to believe that on the chemical level one cannot
transmute metals. To avoid the fate of the alchemists, it.
is time we asked where we stand. Now, before we invest more
time and money on the information-processing level, we should
ask whether the protocols of human subjects suggest that computer language is appropriate for analyzing human behavior.
Is an exhaustive analysis of human intelligent behavior
into discrete and determinate operations possible? Is an
approximate analysis of human intelligent behavior in such
digital terms probable? The answer to both these questions
seems to be, &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Democracy and reinforcement learning</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 16:25:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/democracy/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the age-old battle between representative vs direct democracy, two systems stand out.

You can find anti-market rhetoric coming from everywhere in the political spectrum (see here &lt;a href="https://unherd.com/2022/07/britain-needs-macmillan-not-thatcher/%29">https://unherd.com/2022/07/britain-needs-macmillan-not-thatcher/)&lt;/a>, but no real intervention gets in motion. We see the &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; investing more and more on absurd products (insta-remote-shopping (?!)), while neglecting anything of value, but forces-that-be accept it as part of the natural order of things (kind of like gravity), nothing can be done about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soviet computing history</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/sovietcomp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:32:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/sovietcomp/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a big fan of personal/home computing, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pity that IBM PC clones dominated the market to such an extent that we are left with no alternatives (except, perhaps, the apple lines).

&lt;p>Mage is one of the most idealistic games you can play.

As most post-80&amp;rsquo;s RPG, Mage is hugely optimistic about technological advancement.

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;Such is the position both in France and in Great Britain. Comrade Crispien does not regard the split like a Communist, but quite in the spirit of Kautsky, who is supposed to have no influence. Then Crispien went on to speak of high wages. The position in Germany, he said, is that the workers are quite well off compared with the workers in Russia or in general, in the East of Europe. A revolution, as he sees it, can be made only if it does not worsen the workers’ conditions “too much”. Is it permissible, in a Communist Party, to speak in a tone like this, I ask? This is the language of counter-revolution. The standard of living in Russia is undoubtedly lower than in Germany, and when we established the dictatorship, this led to the workers beginning to go more hungry and to their conditions becoming even worse. The workers’ victory cannot be achieved without sacrifices, without a temporary deterioration of their conditions. We must tell the workers the very opposite of what Crispien has said. If, in desiring to prepare the workers for the dictatorship, one tells them that their conditions will not be worsened “too much”, one is losing sight of the main thing, namely, that it was by helping their “own” bourgeoisie to conquer and strangle the whole world by imperialist methods, with the aim of thereby ensuring better pay for themselves, that the labour aristocracy developed. &lt;strong>If the German workers now want to work for the revolution they must make sacrifices, and not be afraid to do so.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The renegade Kautsky</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/kauts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 11:56:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/kauts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8033846-revolutionary-strategy">Mike Macnair&amp;rsquo;s Revolutionary Strategy: Marxism and the challenge of left unity&lt;/a>, and it occurred to me there is a whole world out there of ideas and topics that could be helped by more formal analysis, and by that I mean a more rigorous approach to quantify the outcomes of each topic, the parameters that would go in it and the debates that it would spark.

Quite a few of us feel that the implicit promises of an interconnected world were broken and we need to go back to the prophets. A quick guide for creating your own website the same way you would do it 15 years ago is this one: &lt;a href="https://thoughts.melonking.net/guides/?c=websites">Web revival&lt;/a>. I like the &lt;em>goals&lt;/em> of these movements, I am not sure I am convinced with the approach the author is taking. There is no need to build a web site without modern static generators (hugo, jekyll), and markdown is such a great authoring tool. The modern tool stack is vastly superior to the one we had in the 90s.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The brick bible</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/bb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 07:38:12 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/bb/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have two go-to websites when I need a quick, cheap laugh &amp;ndash; the first is one is the &lt;a href="https://thebricktestament.com/the_law/slavery/ex21_20b.html">Brick Bible&lt;/a>.

The article can be summed up as a commentary on whether one should pursue theoretical methods vs a more experimental approach (i.e. neats vs scruffies) and has been done to death since the article was written, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much new to say. What astonished me is the actual focus on education. The piece reads like something written in another universe. There is no link to outcomes (which invariably means how many students will we get if we follow approach A vs approach B or where will these students get jobs). It&amp;rsquo;s like the authors only concern is what scientifically valid AI education looks like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big data</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/bigdata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 09:31:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/bigdata/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most interesting problems I have encountered in my real-life expeditions involve small data.

This is particularly prevalent among right-wing bloggers; somehow the idle classes have decided that the elites are overworked middle-class professionals and art school graduates. What I find astonishing is that the same middle classes, while losing privileges and status like never before, quite often internalise this &amp;ldquo;elite&amp;rdquo; self-image and focus all their efforts on cultural issues of tertiary importance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Observational data and politics</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/gorbi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 11:18:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/gorbi/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the age old debate between socialism vs capitalism (the really existing ones, not whatever idealised versions are theoretically possible) empirical studies are sorely lacking.

 The politics of eclipse phase (the game) play nicely as an exploration of a post-scarcity world, where humanity struggles to come to terms with the widespread availability of futuristic tech (makers, full AIs, full body augmentations), but material constraints are mostly not there. Similar themes emerge in &lt;a href="http://www.peterfrase.com">Peter Frase&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2011/12/four-futures">four futures&lt;/a> essay. Two binary variables (scarcity and equality) are flipped to create four different potential futures. What is interesting to me is that 10 years ago writers on the left were seriously discussing the prospects of a post-scarcity world. Globalisation had made production invisible and overly optimistic AI promises probably created a certain feeling at the time. This optimism is no longer there, and quite a bit of thinking needs to be done as to where we are in terms of production capacity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Games and will appropriation</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/ga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 08:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/ga/</guid><description>&lt;p>I often wonder whether the fact that games were generally thought of as the quintessential analogue of intelligence is just due to their clear links with liberalism; you have an environment and you have agents that try to maximise some notion of reward in that environment. Life seems radically different (no clear rewards, no environmental resets, no fixed set of actions, no clear transition function), but most games provide a good abstraction for a competitive universe. Nobody plays games were your first state is the most rewarding state &amp;ndash; rewards accumulate over time. You start as a horrible low life and you keep getting progressively refined as a player/agent to the point where you reach some far away game heaven, the land of high scores and opponent defeats. The traditional control paradigm had an inverse reward structure &amp;ndash; you start happy, but your environment tries to make you miserable, so you need to discover the right set of actions to remain stable. Mathematically, you end up with exactly the same solutions, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of perception. More modern work sometimes does away with external rewards completely, and just assumes that an agent maximises some internal intrinsic reward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blade runner's soundtrack</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/br/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 20:38:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/br/</guid><description>&lt;p>The composer of Blade Runner&amp;rsquo;s soundtrack, Vangelis, &lt;a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/vangelis-papathanassiou-dead-at-79">died a couple of days ago&lt;/a>.

 McKinsey (the consultancy) has a job automation chart &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/where-machines-could-replace-humans-and-where-they-cant-yet">here&lt;/a>, posted in 2016. There seems to be a lingering fear of automation, as this old New York Time article, amply named &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1955/04/08/archives/automation-puts-industry-on-eve-of-fantastic-robot-era-its-effect.html">&amp;ldquo;Automation Puts Industry on Eve of Fantastic Robot Era; Its Effect on Workers Spurs Unions&amp;rsquo; Drive for Annual Wage&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> seems to imply. Notice how McKinsey speculates that managers are secure from automation, though I doubt this is for the right reasons. Middle management is automated to death (think: algorithms and uber), but upper management is the one driving any automation forward and somehow I greatly doubt they will automate their own jobs. Rodney Brooks (of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921889005800259">Elephants don&amp;rsquo;t play chess&lt;/a> fame) keeps an automation &lt;a href="https://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2022-january-01/">score card&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; makes for a very interesting read for a more grounded perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In praise of idleness</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/praise/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2022 07:02:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/praise/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;figure class="floatleft">&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/Office_space_poster.jpg">

Early in my career, over a break, I approached a co-worker of mine and complained that all of my life&amp;rsquo;s problems were due to my relationship with work. I had watched &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space&lt;/a> the day before, still one of my favourite movies, and almost shed tears of joy seeing that others understood the very same concept, that most of the time we spend on work is meaningless. To my surprise I got back an answer along the lines of &amp;ldquo;what else is there to do in life?&amp;rdquo;. It was not an argument stemming from the necessity or virtue of work but from sheer boredom, something that had never occurred to me, as I had tons of interests I wanted to pursue in my free time. I stumbled upon Russell&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Bertrand%20Russell%20-%20In%20Praise%20of%20Idleness.pdf">Praise of Idleness&lt;/a> shortly after, which led me to economic planning (quoting: &amp;ldquo;Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others overwork&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;). Some of the issues Russell ignores (e.g. problem of finding which products to create) are harder than what was imagined in the 1930s and pretty much still unsolved, which is why planned economies risk looking like fully balanced optimal economies frozen 40 years in the past. When it comes to boredom, Russell understood the problem of having nothing to do outside work and had a concept of active vs passive entertainment (e.g. playing football vs watching football), with a strong preference for the former.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gnostic vs Orthodox</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/gnos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 07:33:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/gnos/</guid><description>&lt;p>Philip K. Dick&amp;rsquo;s Valis contains quite a bit of commentary that I find fundamental in understanding gnostic thought. Dick, in his interpretation of Gnosticism, points to an &lt;em>intellectual&lt;/em> error for the fall of man (and hence our short lives of toil, pain and labour) rather than the usual orthodox position of &lt;em>moral&lt;/em> failure. Interestingly enough, Dick created his own gnostic mythology (which reads like a modern version of the already bizarre gnostic cosmogony, replacing gods with aliens). Two versions of the Gnostic creation myth are depicted Figure 1 &amp;ndash; they are extremely idealistic and more abstract the the biblical creation myth, which might point to early Gnostics being more of an esoteric cult.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtuals vs Reals</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/va/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 07:25:53 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/va/</guid><description>&lt;p>An essay that has been making rounds since it was published is &lt;a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/reality-honks-back">N.S.

It discusses Canadian truckers and the divide between &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; workers (which make use of real-world tools tools) and &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; workers (which deal primarily in information). It contains a flawed effort to link the whole divide to Gnosticism &amp;ndash; it astonishes me that the only modern author that somehow got the Gnostics was P.K. Dick in Valis &amp;ndash; but beyond that the whole argument is very convincing. There is a two-tier workforce that has started to develop different ways of thinking and covid cemented this divide; it has made the virtuals more isolated and more dependent on state fictions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measures and fairness</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/mm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 06:58:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/mm/</guid><description>&lt;p>A superb article popped in my twitter feed called &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05511.pdf">Measurement and Fairness&lt;/a>. The article, as the title implies, deals with the imaginary quantities (e.g. teacher quality) and how operationalising them via actual measurements is where the problem of using metrics (I use the word interchangeably with &amp;ldquo;measures&amp;rdquo;) lies; in terms closer to AI/statistics, how to you link latent variables with observed variables. What strikes me is how fragile the notion of latent variable creation is; one can create whatever metric/measure they want, operationalise it in whatever way they think suits them and use enough force and propaganda to reshape the world according to their fiction. I tend to disagree with Chalmer that these &lt;a href="http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf">fictions created through latent variables are real&lt;/a>, at least they do not feel real to me, but one cannot but notice that their impact is very real and ranges from wars to going to the moon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measures tend to become targets</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/metrics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 09:34:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/metrics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most complaints about gaming a system can be traced back to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart&amp;rsquo;s law&lt;/a>, i.e. &amp;ldquo;when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure&amp;rdquo;. In the most trivial of scenarios, let us imagine that an oversight institution is created to measure the quality of teaching, and they come up with &amp;ldquo;average GPA&amp;rdquo;, which takes the mean of all student GPAs at a certain school. The minute this is measured and compiled in a table, someone will start ranking schools according to average GPA. School principals and education boards will see this and start competing on average GPAs, thus creating a target. Now, political pressures is going to be applied to the oversight institute to modify this target in ways that favours certain schools (e.g. combining average GPA with teaching hours) and from that point onwards its games and meta-games around fictional targets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adversus ludii, adversus ludos</title><link>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 16:15:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ssamot.me/posts/adv_games/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="quick-self-bio">Quick self-bio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I entered AI through games; I&amp;rsquo;ve started my PhD thinking roughly that if we manage to solve poker (or more generally, games of imperfection and/or incompleteness), we will manage to more or less solve the problem of AI; solving the problem of AI meant solving the problem of labour.

The response to the modern problem of being alone, alienated and having lost your soul is obviously becoming part of a welcoming community; in contrast, idolising traditional societies seems to me to be a symptom of &lt;strong>excessive&lt;/strong> alienation. We can&amp;rsquo;t even conceive what it would take so as not to be alienated and we are inventing a fantasy golden past to go back to. I think the clues for what would constitute a sane societal organisation would come from consciousness studies and the &amp;ldquo;differentiated yet integrated&amp;rdquo; approach they seem to be converging on. Using reinforcement learning as a more practical analogy, you would need to setup societies like &lt;a href="http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/camato/decpomdp/overview.htmlDEC-POMDPs">Dec-POMDPs&lt;/a>, where there is a clear alignment between the rewards of the group and the rewards of the individual.

Ultimately, human salvation lies in the conditions of production, or as Aristotle would put it in his oft-quoted passage &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/aristotle-on-household-robots">&amp;ldquo;There is only one condition in which we can imagine managers not needing subordinates, and masters not needing slaves.

Yet, somehow, this is not enough; as another &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfharlIQ2qE">video mocking Tesla&lt;/a> for its inability to produce a self-driving car points out, the promise of real-world AI delivering anything that would resemble its science fiction counterpart is astoundingly far.

Tesla operates within the mantle of extreme technological optimism, an almost default positions given the level of change the world has seen since the industrial revolution.
