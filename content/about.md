I am a senior lecturer in data science -- see here for [my institutional website](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/samot88004/spyros-samothrakis). My research focuses are on broader AI themes; I've started as a game AI researcher, but my interests have since drifted towards out-of-distribution generalisation, robustness and causal inference, though I still maintain a healthy interest in games. I also have side interests on how to build new societal institutions and a general fascination with religion. I am also a big fun of tabletop role playing games (Shadowrun, D&D, Warhammer, Mage the Ascension).
