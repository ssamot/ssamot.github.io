{{< figure src="/face_me_s3.jpg" caption="Working hard..." class="floatleft"  >}}I am a senior lecturer in data science -- see here for [my institutional website](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/samot88004/spyros-samothrakis). My research focuses on broader AI themes; I've started as a game AI researcher, but my interests have since drifted towards out-of-distribution generalisation, robustness and causal inference, though I still maintain a healthy passion for games. I also enjoy thinking how to build new societal institutions and have a general fascination with religion. I am a big fan of tabletop role playing games (Shadowrun, D&D, Warhammer, Mage the Ascension).
