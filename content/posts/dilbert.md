One of my favourite comic strips is Dilbert -- his HR takes are insanely good -- see here: https://dilbert.com/strip/2022-07-15. The most fundamental line of thought in AI is the direct link between intelligence and agency, and Dilbert is making fun of the typical game NPC, someone with no real role in the world apart from just existing. Acting with purpose is also one of the fundamental tenets of liberalism, which poses a conception of humanity as agents in a cosmic game. There is argument to be made that we have reached a point where the vast majority has actually adopted this active stance in life.  What if we are all acting at the limit of our willpower, and are only constrained by our abilities?
