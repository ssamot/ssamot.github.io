Basic storytelling has a very simple, yet compelling design -- see here: 
https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit

1. A character is in a zone of comfort,
1. But they want something.
1. They enter an unfamiliar situation,
1. Adapt to it,
1. Get what they wanted,
1. Pay a heavy price for it,
1. Then return to their familiar situation,
1. Having changed.

I am not that comfortable with this as the basic arc of life, it involves way too much luck, and can only work in a stable world where you can try and fail as many times as you like. I wonder if there is a book of stories (something like [Eureka](https://enginepublishing.com/eureka-501-adventure-plots-to-inspire-game-masters)) where this arc is followed, but the hero fails miserably along the path. E.g. you can fail at point 4, failing to adapt to an unfamiliar situation. Point 5 is a nice place to fail as well, you adapt but you get nothing. 

Games that try to capture the comedic effects of failure and (maybe) over-ambition include [Fiasco](https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/fiasco), and movies include [Fargo](https://enginepublishing.com/eureka-501-adventure-plots-to-inspire-game-masters).
