William Wordsworth's poem ["She Was a Phantom of Delight"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45550/she-was-a-phantom-of-delight) has gotten a new life through netflix  third edition of "Love, Death and Robots". The specific quote is:

> And now I see with eye serene <br>
> The very pulse of the machine; <br>
> A Being breathing thoughtful breath, <br>
> A Traveller between life and death; <br>

I originally thought the poem was about some kind of occult revelation the author had, but apparently is a love poem to his wife!
