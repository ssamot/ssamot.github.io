Almost all complaints about gaming a system can be traced back to [Goodhart's_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law)), i.e. "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". This is obvious in trivial scenarios; if you rank teachers according to how high the marks they hand out are, there is a good chance you will ruin educational standards. An oversight institution introducing such a metric would need to make sure that every other variable of interest (e.g. the difficulty of a course) remains fixed during a multi-year optimisation process. In turn, this necessitates constant monitoring (so as to make sure that the constraints are not violated), which creates an overall situation that is both unpleasant and detrimental. If one adds the flexible metric definitions (i.e. whom do you consider unemployed if you are to calculate an employment rate), it is almost certain that overall the only "real" thing that most of these metrics optimise is the salaries in the wider propaganda sector (politics, marketing, advertising etc.) that come up with them.
