I've just finished reading Flowers of Algernon -- picked it up from a thread in [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31875692) -- it's such a great read. The style of writing changing throughout the book makes for a great literally vehicle -- Charlie starts writing phonetically (i.e. the same way I write Greek...), moves on to super-proper-scientist style (following a "smartification" procedure) and finally falls back to his original style as he gradually reverts back. It's also a rather sad tale; the ability to understand one's limits without being able to exceed them is painful.
