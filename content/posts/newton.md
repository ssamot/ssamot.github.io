Newton is well known for his alchemical and theological writings. There is a table in https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/593608.Isaac_Newton, a biography of Newton which I read almost 20 years ago, which summarises Neuton's prophecies. They were apparently derived from a close reading of the Bible, and not by any form of revelation. It's not clear to me how he came up with these dates, or if the table has any validity at all. Another set of dates is reported here: https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/cjh_newton_03.pdf, with the Kingdom of God arriving at 2060 -- not sure how this fits with the dates in the table below nor do I get why and how the prophecies of Daniel play up with Revelations.  

| Date  | Event  |
|---|---|
| 2436AD - end  | Second resurrection, Last Judgement, leading to the end of the Christian era |
| 2370-2436AD  | Cleansing of the Sanctuary - beginning of 1,000 years of peace   |
| 1948AD | Second coming of Christ |
| 1944AD | End of the great tribulation of the Jews
| 1899AD | Call to return to Jerusalem
| 609-800AD  | Period during which Roman Catholic Church (the "Whore of Babylon") was at its peak  |
|70AD | Transgression of desolation of Jerusalem |
|34AD | Death of Christ |
|2BC |Birth of Christ |
|456-500BC |The Jews return to Jerusalem|
