The composer of Blade Runner's soundtrack, Vangelis, [died a couple of days ago](https://www.loudersound.com/news/vangelis-papathanassiou-dead-at-79). I cannot think of a more iconic cyberpunk soundtrack then the score of the original 1982 film. As an interesting side fact, the story of the film is set to take place in 2019. It's 2022 and still no androids...
