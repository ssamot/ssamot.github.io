I am getting back my passion for sci-fi novels (gradually...) and starting reading more Shadowrun stuff. The Earthdown/Shadowrun cross-over is superb, and points to a comment I discovered in reddit some time ago on why Shadowrun tech feels different. The timelines of the main players are measured in millennia (vs six months), and that allows them to do long term thinking (and hence deep research).
