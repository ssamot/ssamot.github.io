An interesting aspect of the anti-Christian polemic these three philosophers have authored is that all of them seem to have a henotheistic take on religion, but differ on the validity of the Christian teachings. Julian, being the last in line,  more or less claims that if you only read Christian works, you will end acting like a slave, whereas if you complement your education with Graeco(-Roman) classics you should be able to appreciate the Hero's Journey (or that's how I read it at least). Celsus seems to despise the slave element, but I guess Julian thinks there is something valuable there, which shows some kind of transformation taking place. 

Not sure why I am reading neo-platonism on Easter Sunday, but I guess I am that much of a contrarian.
