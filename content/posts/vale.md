So I've been trying to get atomic-vale to work in atom (the editor). Took me a while, as on top of a working vale installation, you need to install the linter plugins. From the command line do:

{{< highlight sh "linenos=false" >}}
apm install linter
{{< / highlight >}}

The functionality vale provide is exceptionally good, and I am surprised I haven't heard of this before -- I first read about it in hacker news post.
