Chappo trap house is reviewing [Lachmann, Richard. First Class Passengers on a Sinking Ship: Elite Politics and the Decline of Great Powers. Verso Books, 2020.](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3062-first-class-passengers-on-a-sinking-ship) The book uses binary tables to make its arguments -- and it is a  pleasure to read. An example is the one below. Notice how we have fewer samples than required to exhaust the search space. What I find interesting is how elite-heavy his account it. Contrast with Schweitzer's ideas on "interim ethics" and Christianity on brining down the Roman elites. 


C = high level of elite conflict in metropole,
A = high level of colonial elite autonomy from metropole,
U = unitary elite dominant in metropole,
I = lack infrastructural capacity to control colonial elites
