{{< figure src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTB6EoeXsAEfMy8?format=jpg&name=large" caption="Automation fears in the 50s, found on twitter, see https://twitter.com/abenanav/status/1526854505136021505" class="floatleft"  >}} McKinsey (the consultancy) has a job automation chart [here](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/where-machines-could-replace-humans-and-where-they-cant-yet), posted in 2016. There seems to be a lingering fear of automation, as this old New York Time article, amply named ["Automation Puts Industry on Eve of Fantastic Robot Era; Its Effect on Workers Spurs Unions' Drive for Annual Wage"](https://www.nytimes.com/1955/04/08/archives/automation-puts-industry-on-eve-of-fantastic-robot-era-its-effect.html) seems to imply. Notice how McKinsey speculates that managers are secure from automation, though I doubt this is for the right reasons. Middle management is automated to death (think: algorithms and uber), but upper management is the one driving any automation forward and somehow I greatly doubt they will automate their own jobs.
