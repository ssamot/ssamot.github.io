I make use of the common data science frameworks for my everyday work (sklearn, pandas, tensorflow, seaborn and the like). For game-specific stuff I find [Openspiel](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel) indispensable. It does everything in a very nice API -- from standard RL methods to LP solvers for normal form games to integration with a ton of languages.
