I was looking today for machine-readable bibles -- apparently tons of them are here: https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModDisp.jsp?modType=Bibles and there is a python library to process them here: https://pypi.org/project/pysword/. I was surprised how long it took me to actually find these resources -- I was expecting that a google search would reveal the truth (:P), but nope...
