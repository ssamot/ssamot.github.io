Forbes has an article on [ghost quitting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/08/04/how-many-of-your-co-workers-are-showing-signs-of-ghost-quitting/?sh=4057f6f74d32). In my life before-becoming-an-academic, I remember having discussions about work and quite often being surprised by coworkers claiming that they have nothing else to spend their time on but work.

It might be bizarre, but I still find meaning in trying to beat games.
