An essay that has been making rounds since it was published is [N.S. Lyons' Reality Honks Back](https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/reality-honks-back). It discusses Canadian truckers and the divide between "real" workers (which make use of real-world tools tools) and "virtual" workers (which deal primarily in information). It contains a flawed effort to link the whole divide to Gnosticism -- it astonishes me that the only modern author that somehow got the Gnostics was P.K. Dick in Valis -- but beyond that the whole argument is very convincing. There is a two-tier workforce that has started to develop different ways of thinking and covid cemented this divide; it has made the virtuals more isolated and more dependent on state fictions.
