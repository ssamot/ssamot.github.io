Most of what is written about automation is not worth reading -- mostly patentable techno-utopian rubbish, but this newly released article actually gets it: 

Quoting directly from:

> For now, it is worth noting that automation canâ€™t solve the necessary labor problem because (a) some kinds of necessary labor, like education and health care and childcare, cannot be fully automated; (b) some kinds of necessary labor, from construction to agriculture, might in principle be fully automatable but not in the near or even moderate-distance future; (c) many kinds of automation eliminate some tasks but create new ones that require human beings; and (d) machines have to be monitored and repaired, so even where machines do fully replace human beings, the necessary labor of maintenance remains.

Graeber (I think in Debt: The first 5000 years) mentions that the first slaves where actually used for caring duties/household reproduction, and it seems to me that we are as far away from automating this kind of labour as ever.
