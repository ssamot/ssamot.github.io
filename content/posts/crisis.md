There is this quote, in the now legendary [Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young](https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column-column.html) that goes to show how certain truths of the post 1945 consensus are not with us any more:

> Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

* We had deflationary pressures for years.
* Politicians where never noble.
* Children were always children.

We do get old though...
