Quite often it seems to me that the modern left (of the liberal sort) has lost its ways completely. It has dissociated itself form the material basis of reality to such an extend it can do nothing more then quietly complain as life happens. It wishes for a world that cannot exist.

There are really no answers; the left is hoping for technological solutions (in this case, artificial wombs?), but in the meantime I guess its happy with surrogacy. The right has no answers either, as meaningful state intervention of any kind goes against its core beliefs.
