I was searching for a timeline of world events, and I stumbled upon this: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~cpd/history.html. It's a "Timeline of human evolution and cultural development", as it's author would describe it, and it's one of the most useful resources on the topic I've seen. I've used this script [here](/code/extract_table.py) to extract the relevant tables into CSV format for future processing.
