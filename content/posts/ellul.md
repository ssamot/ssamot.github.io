Quoting from [Ellul's "The New Demons"](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1362676)

>> The remarkable thing is that, "while excluding the
existence, the essence, the name and the reality of God, Jainism
and Buddhism very soon become authentic religions." The
religionizing power is so strong that Christianity (which I am
deeply convinced is antireligious) is finally engulfed and is progresÂ­
sively transformed into a religion. Then the movement of scientific
rationalism, extended by Marxist, materialistic rationalism, winds
up recreating the religious in the world. Religion even inserts itself
into militant atheism. Marx, in his famous passage in German
Ideology, longed to see the disappearance of atheism at the same
time as that of religion. Moreover, it is common knowledge that, in
his view, Voltaire's anti-Christianity was nothing but a form of
religion.

I find the above truly puzzling. I am still not sure what he means by religion. Superstition? The Church? Thinking in absolutes?


>> place. They are at last having a part in serious worship. The
moment an artist is "committed," he becomes a hero. Joan Baez,
Melina Mercouri, Yves Montand are beginning to acquire a dignity
superior to Hollywood stars. They are having a part in man's
struggle for man. They are not yet model heroes, but they have
already entered the religious sphere.

Mercouri I tend to think of as a minister of culture. The book was published in 1975, so I guess the author had something else mind :P 

>> moment when one claims to be freeing Christianity from the
religious hodgepodge which has burdened it for twenty centuries,
and from such religious mistakes as the belief in miracles, or the
unconditioned authority of Scripture, or the formulation of
the name of God, one reintroduces religion. This is not done in the
traditional idiom but, as always, in the contemporary idiom. Thus
the theology of the death of God is, above all, a theology of the
modem religionizing of Christianity.
