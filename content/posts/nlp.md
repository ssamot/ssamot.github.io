I really don't get all that hype around large language models. I can understand their uses in NLP (and their superb transfer learning powers), but people are treating them like the end-goal of AI. I might be biased, but they don't look that smart to me -- I've tried he one here: https://6b.eleuther.ai/. You get different results based on what parameters you use, but:

Model with top-p = 1.0, temperature = 0 (i.e. choose best -- I guess that's what it means -- you get really bizarre results with the default website parameters)

Q: Is carbon needed for steel?

A:I have been reading a lot about steel lately and I have been wondering if carbon is needed for steel. I have read that carbon is needed for steel to be strong and hard. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be ductile. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be magnetic. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be rust resistant. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be heat resistant. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be corrosion resistant. I have also read that carbon is needed for steel to be weldable. 

Q: How do I make a hamburger?

A: You can use the following code to make a hamburger:
&lt;div class="hamburger"&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

.hamburger {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-color: #
