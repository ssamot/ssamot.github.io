I got across this list of 4 blog posts that describe ancient religion as a form of black box technology, with the inner mechanisms being latent. You do a ritual, you expect certain results if you do it properly and if the Gods agreed. Very RL-y (you do certain actions, dice are rolled, you do or do not get the reward).

It must have been Augustine who brought the extreme version of orthodoxy into Christianity -- unless you believe certain things, you will end up suffering eternally.
