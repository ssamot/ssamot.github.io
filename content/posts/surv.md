The [EU](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chat-control-eu-commission-presents-mass-surveillance-plan-on-may-11/) and [UK](https://www.eff.org/issues/uk-investigatory-powers-bill) governments are desperate for our data, and this has been the case for a while. I have no idea what they plan to do with it (most people's lives are super boring, what kind of political dissent are they looking for?), but [Briar](https://briarproject.org/index.html), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) seem reasonable, sane alternatives.
