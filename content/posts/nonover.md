So today being the day/date it is, it might be worth posting one of Mark Fisher's lectures. 

{{< youtube aCgkLICTskQ >}}

Fisher had a profound impact on quite a few of us, with [Capitalism Realism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6763725-capitalist-realism) articulating the anguish felt from the settlement of the post-90s social contract, i.e. that all human interactions are to be mediated through the market (or fake market-like mechanisms where no real market has emerged), by means of communication technologies. 

It's been almost 15 years since the book was published, and there has been very little to no progress in the social front. It is clear to me that we lack real world movements (but we write a lot) -- we take ["non-overlapping magisteria"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190403152432/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html) in all our life fronts too seriously and end up with very fragmented virtual lives. 

Integrating everything back together might prove more challenging then once thought, but I can't see any other way out.  Quoting: https://cushbomb.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Marxism

> The spiritual implications of reattaching ones subjectivity to the external world involves an immersion in to existing community structures, as well as activities and pastimes that remind the individual of the fundamental materiality of existence.
