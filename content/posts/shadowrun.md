{{< figure src="/shadowrun.jpeg" caption="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/78877/shadowrun-first-edition" class="floatleft"  >}} Shadowrun (the game) can be read as wish for vengeance against colonizers. There are means to manipulate the world that do not have their origins in European thought (i.e. science, technology) and can deliver mega-violence. Some kind of response to Toledo steel, the machine gun and the atom bomb; it invariably involves spirits (e.g. the great ghost dance) or some other form of magic. Nature literally fights back and indigenous tribes now have means to down helicopters. 

As with everything else in shadowrun (and early 80s/90s predictions), this never came to be.
