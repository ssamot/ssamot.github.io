"A strange game. The only winning move is not to play" goes the quote from the movie Wargames (a sci-fi classic) and applies widely to most constant-sum games. There are far more of them than we would like to admit, but interestingly enough we seem to avoid talking about games of strict competition in the context of human existence, as I guess the discussion is uncomfortable. From [Cobb, John B., and David Ray Griffin. Process theology: An introductory exposition. Westminster John Knox Press, 1976.](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Process_Theology.html?id=rVbZjQTCNmkC&redir_esc=y), I quote: 

> Any proposal to limit population growth by government regulations so as to make possible a viable future is quickly critiÂ­cized for its threats to personal liberty, if not on the moralistic grounds that any interference with reproductive processes is "sin."

At first glance, this might seem irrelevant, but the author is showing an appreciation of constant-sum games. Why would there be a need to be less of us if the games humans play are not general-sum? The quote above is also the only point in the book that anything like strict competition for anything is even alluded in the text.
