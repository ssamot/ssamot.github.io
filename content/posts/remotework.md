A number of businesses seem to be enforcing a 5-days-a-week-back-to-the-office policy, and obviously some high profile resignations have taken place. Looking at the products I use, they seem to be designed by companies that had a remote work policy even before the pandemic, and somehow I doubt this is an accident.
