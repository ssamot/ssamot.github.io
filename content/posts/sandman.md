Neil Gaiman's "the sandman" is one of the first comic books I've read (early in my 20s). I thoroughly enjoy the Neflix adaptation; episode 5 does a great play on lies and dreams. If you remove dreams, all that remains are the basic instincts (sex and death).

What makes the whole endeavour interesting is the link between AI, failed prophecies and the post 1980s world. We need dreams to keep moving, but what happens when dreams are served on a platter? Quoting Guy Debord:

> The spectacle is the nightmare of imprisoned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep.

My guess is that you probably get food poisoning from having the wrong mental diet -- seems like lies are to dreams what poison is to medicine.
