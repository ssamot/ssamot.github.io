I am a big fan of personal/home computing, and it's a pity that IBM PC clones dominated the market to such an extent that we are left with no alternatives (except, perhaps, the apple lines). It's also rather interesting that US dominance was so complete, that no other country managed to to maintain local variants. I also wonder how much of it was down to resources/economics or technical capacity. The soviets would have to overhaul their whole economic system if they were to introduce computers successfully.
