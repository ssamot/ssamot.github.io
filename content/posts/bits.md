Paraphrasing Irenaeus, here is a great video I discovered almost by mistake, which I think both highlights the distinction between virtual and real and kind of ends the discussion on the possibility of blockchains being of any use on authenticating anything that is not virtual.

So, In the wise words of James Hoffmann (segment starts at 00:07:46.280)

> "Ooh, an issue with transparency. That's a problem that the
blockchain could solve."
No, no, you can still submit
false, fraudulent information
to the blockchain.
And all you're doing is
writing with a very permanent,
very wasteful marker into the ledger.
In fact, I'd argue that it
would probably enable fraud
by giving a kind of veneer of authenticity
to a fraudulent product.
So please, no blockchain.
