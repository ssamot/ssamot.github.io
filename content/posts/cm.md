I thoroughly admire efforts to turn mathematics into code -- in the legacy of [Coding the Matrix](http://codingthematrix.com/). A new book is being released on the topic of Logic: [Mathematical Logic through Python](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/mathematical-logic-through-python). Proof assistants (the likes of [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean)) are being continuously developed and becoming more and more mainstream by the hour. I am pretty sure developments in these fronts will revolutionise the teaching of mathematics, making them accessible to whole groups of hobbyists, the same way that autodiff revolutionised ML.
