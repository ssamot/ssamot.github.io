I don't have much to say here apart from posting two quotes from two my favourite authors: 

Terry Pratchett: 
> And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. Thatâ€™s what sin is.

Philip K. Dick: 
> We did not fall because of a moral error; we fell because of an intellectual error: that of taking the phenomenal world as real.
