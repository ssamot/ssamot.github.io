I was reading this morning [Law, Stephen. "The evil-god challenge." Religious Studies 46.3 (2010): 353-373.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0034412509990369) and [Stein, Edward. "God, the demon, and the status of theodicies." American Philosophical Quarterly 27.2 (1990): 163-167.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20014323.pdf).

What is being claimed, more or less, is that one can create negative theodicies (i.e. why the universe is ruled/has been created by  an evil deity) as easily as positive ones. It looks to me that the problem dissolves if you just accept that the universe/God/whatever you want to call it has no inherent moral position (or that its moral position is evolving, see [Jung's Answer to Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Job)).
