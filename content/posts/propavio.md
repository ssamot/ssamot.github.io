One of the most persisting beliefs I keep coming across is that the world will change because of some sort of excessive sinning by the societal elites, and the only action one needs to take is to expose this sinning. The argument goes something like this: 

(a) The elites sin excessively (they are too self-indulgent, do not care about anything but themselves, too hedonistic, clueless, sadistic, you-name-it)
(b) We will reveal the cruelty and moral decay of the elites (or the system they support) to everyone
(c) All will see how morally bankrupt the elites are and hence start some form of active resistance
(d) The end result of (a),(b) and (c) is political change and/or collapse.

This model has been put forward numerous times since the 2008 crisis; if something does not change here and now, "the people" will rebel. Spread the truth -- or, in biblical terms: 


> (John 8:32) And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free


The truth might set you (spiritually) free, but it won't change anything around you. There is no reason for someone in a position of power (i.e. the elites) to abandon it because their moral decay (?!) or incompetence has been exposed or for anyone to rebel because they now know the truth. Life is good when you are in the top of the world. As Empress Theodora would put it: 

> If you wish safety, my Lord, that is an easy matter. We are rich, and there is the sea, and yonder our ships. But consider whether if you reach safety you may not desire to exchange that safety for death. As for me, I like the old saying, that the purple is the noblest shroud.
 
Any change would require counteracting the machine of propaganda and violence that sucks labour and resources and spews back wealth and power that is in the centre of it all. The obvious way to do it is by creating another machine of propaganda and violence that can topple it, or, in biblical terms performing an exorcism using a stronger demon than the one currently in place: 

> (Matthew 12:24) But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  


There must be some way to perform this exorcism in the name of the Holy Spirit, it's been quite some since it's been last attempted...
