One of the common tropes in Marxism (or, in fact, most forms of liberalism) is the rational organisation of society. This collective rationality ultimately stems from aggregates of individual rationality, either organised top-down or bottom up. Rationality alone does not suffice for anything it seems, not even building core tech. We need to attach some form of transcendental meaning to anything we do, even if it's technology.
