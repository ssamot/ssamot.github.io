Philip K. Dick's Valis contains quite a bit of commentary that I find fundamental in understanding gnostic thought. Dick, in his interpretation of Gnosticism, points to an *intellectual* error for the fall of man (and hence our short lives of toil, pain and labour) rather than the usual orthodox position of *moral* failure. Interestingly enough, Dick created his own gnostic mythology (which reads like a modern version of the already bizarre gnostic cosmogony, replacing gods with aliens). Two versions of the Gnostic creation myth are depicted Figure 1 -- they are extremely idealistic and more abstract the the biblical creation myth, which might point to early Gnostics being more of an esoteric cult.
