I have two go-to websites when I need a quick, cheap laugh -- the first is one is the [Brick Bible](https://thebricktestament.com/the_law/slavery/ex21_20b.html). The author/artist takes some of the more controversial parts of scripture and renders them (with commentary) to Lego scenes. The second website is the comment section of Motley Crue youtube videos ("Grills, grills, grills").
