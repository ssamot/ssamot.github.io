I find that the whole premise of the lord of the rings is that should you cause greater suffering to achieve some greater good, you end up with some form of greater evil -- the prime modern example being [The Road to Terror Stalin and the Self-Destruction of the Bolsheviks, 1932-1939](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300104073/the-road-to-terror/).  

The antidote to this is slow, gradual, well thought-out movement. You introduce changes bit-by-bit, salami tacticing the problems you face as much as possible and moving the consensus. It's not fancy, but it's stable and brings results; in topics that are of interest to me moving to a fully planned economy (or introducing any big-data-social-improvement project) violently will end in tears -- you would start with social-democratic solutions to alleviate problems here and now and then introduce novelty gradually enterprise by enterprise.
