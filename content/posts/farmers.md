One of the downsides of the western fixation on ruling using the purely ideological means of finance/marketing (i.e. numbers on a computer and propaganda) is the fragility of the whole system. BBC runs an article here https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61958468 on farmers decreasing food output. I find it unbelievable that the collective west is so disinterested in actual production. Supply chains have half-collapsed, gas and oil pipelines are running dry, but the elite priorities keep being the same (i.e. low wages for anyone in the actual production process).

I doubt this will end well...
