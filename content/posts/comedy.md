I often find reviews of higher comedic value than the actual content that is being reviewed. As a kid I used to laugh to the point of tears reading music reviews, and as an adult (?) I still find stuff like [Chapo Trap House' Wolf Warrior Movie Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXGvM6_GiT4) eerily funny. Not sure how popular the genre of "imaginary reviews" (Stanislaw Lem might have popularised it with ["A Perfect Vacuum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Perfect_Vacuum)) actually is, but I can easily imagine a version where non-existent movies, poems, books, music and the like are reviewed, purely for a good laugh.
