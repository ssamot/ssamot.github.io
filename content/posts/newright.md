It seems to me that in the heart of the "new right" thinking lies the Unabomber manifesto, which must have been one of the most persistent producer of memes ("....x has been a disaster for the human race."), and underneath it lies a critique of the modern world. [Fleming, Sean. "The Unabomber and the origins of anti-tech radicalism." Journal of Political Ideologies 27, no. 2 (2022): 207-225.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569317.2021.1921940), which I wouldn't have found if it wasn't the first wikipedia reference for the Unabomber, does a great job breaking down kaczynski's argument.

Central to the premise seem to be three lines of thought (quoting):

1. "...human beings are maladapted to life in a technological society" (Ellul)..."
2. "...consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression (Seligman)..."
3. "... ‘modern society’, like a zookeeper, ‘tends to guarantee the physical necessities to everyone in exchange for only minimal effort’, modern humans are constantly struggling to find stimulation through ‘surrogate activities’..." (Moris)

I find (3) astonishingly wrong, and it seems to me that it forms the basis of "dark enlightenment", tea partiers and the rest. Moris ideas might have been right in the 1960s, where social democracy had some say, western societies would provide some semblance of reasonable life and hope to their subjects and industry would guide your every step (and not in a good way), but it has not been true for years now -- you can conform all you want, and you will still not have a roof over your head. (2) is a thoroughly confused attribution of agency, in the sense that it presupposes that opportunities for escape are given (they are not, there is nowhere to go), but are not taken.  You can't complain about (1) unless you have a ton of internalised theology/belief, and I am not sure where one can find it these days.
