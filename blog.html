    <h2>On Power (2013-09-22)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power" -- Frank Herbert, Children of Dune</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It never ceases to amaze me how the current world elite can behave in such an arrogant manner. Contradictions will be resolved, the great wheels of history will turn again and the world will change once more.</p>
<h2>Top Role-Playing Games according to me (2013-01-19)</h2>

<p>(With an one-liner that I think describes the game)</p>

<p><strong>Mage: The Ascension</strong>, excursions in existentialism and metaphysics. <br />
<strong>Shadowrun</strong>, high tech, low life and magic. <br />
<strong>Eclipse Phase</strong>, politics in a post-scarcity universe. <br />
<strong>Dark Sun</strong>, post apocalyptic Hobbesian desert world.  </p>
<h2>Funboys and Marketeers (2013-01-01)</h2>

<p>I've always wondered who's more morally and intellectually bankrupt. Marketeers, who try to shove down  peoples' throats every new useless gadget their bosses come up with or funboys, who seem to extract all their pleasure from buying whatever new trinkets hit the market. </p>
<h2>GitHub (2012-11-05)</h2>

<p>I am slowly pushing my work to github. Check here <a href="https://github.com/ssamot">https://github.com/ssamot</a>. </p>
<h2>The Matrix Vs Prometheus (2012-06-23)</h2>

<p>I've watched Prometheus a couple of weeks ago. Apart from the obvious inconsistencies of the script (at least as it is portrayed on screen), one cannot overlook the fact that the film poses the same question as "The Matrix".   </p>

<p>"What is wrong with us" ?   </p>

<p>And while matrix echoes the old gnostic heresy of "The universe if fundamentally flawed", Prometheus opts for the more Christian answer of "Humanity is deeply flawed".  </p>

<p>In my game-theoretic mind, I still haven't given an adequate answer to the problem. Is it the environment (i.e. the rules of the game) that preclude us from living in peace with each other or is it our deep irrationality (i.e we are incapable of finding the right equilibria)?  </p>
<h2>First Blog Post (2012-03-10)</h2>

<p>I will post whatever comes to my mind in here (but there is nothing for the moment). The whole site is generated using a python/markdown combo, so no comments - not that anyone would want to comment on anything anyway</p>
