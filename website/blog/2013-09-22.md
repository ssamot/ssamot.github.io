On Power ($date)

>This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power" -- Frank Herbert, Children of Dune

It never ceases to amaze me how the current world elite can behave in such an arrogant manner. Contradictions will be resolved, the great wheels of history will turn again and the world will change once more.
