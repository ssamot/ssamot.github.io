Top Role-Playing Games according to me ($date)
-------------

(With an one-liner that I think describes the game)

**Mage: The Ascension**, excursions in existentialism and metaphysics.  
**Shadowrun**, high tech, low life and magic.  
**Eclipse Phase**, politics in a post-scarcity universe.  
**Dark Sun**, post apocalyptic Hobbesian desert world.
