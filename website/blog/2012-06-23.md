The Matrix Vs Prometheus ($date)
-------------
I've watched Prometheus a couple of weeks ago. Apart from the obvious inconsistencies of the script (at least as it is portrayed on screen), one cannot overlook the fact that the film poses the same question as "The Matrix".   

"What is wrong with us" ?   

And while matrix echoes the old gnostic heresy of "The universe if fundamentally flawed", Prometheus opts for the more Christian answer of "Humanity is deeply flawed".  

In my game-theoretic mind, I still haven't given an adequate answer to the problem. Is it the environment (i.e. the rules of the game) that preclude us from living in peace with each other or is it our deep irrationality (i.e we are incapable of finding the right equilibria)?
